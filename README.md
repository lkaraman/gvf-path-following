# Guiding Vector Control given implicit function

Implementation of path following algorithm given the implicit function based on 
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896317318748

![](example.gif)

Since the mentioned algorithm requires paths to be written
as implicit function, two ways of converting set of points
to the implicit function are implemented:

1. Implication using RBF functions
2. Implication using Fourier elliptics (uses [PyEFD](https://github.com/hbldh/pyefd))

## Testing
Run test with Pytest

## TODOs
- Fix width offset (look at plots!)
- Add setup.py
- Fix/simplify plotting
- More comments in implicators
- Tests
